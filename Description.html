The main game is already complete. If you click on the blank squares, images will show up that have been randomly placed.
	
Our next steps is to animate dealing the cards and flipping the cards over.  There are 'TODO' comments made in as7.html
that specify where the animations need to take place

Once the animations are complete we will add a scoring mechanism.
